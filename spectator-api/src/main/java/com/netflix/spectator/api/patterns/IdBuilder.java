/**
 * Base type for builders that are required to construct an {@link Id} object. This class
 * assists with the creation of a base id and then returns another builder type that can
 * be used for further refinement. By following this pattern the builder will force the
 * user to satisfy the minimal constraints of the id before a final option to construct
 * or complete the operation is provided.
 *
 * <p>Sample usage:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   return new IdBuilder<Builder>(registry) {
 *     {@literal @}Override protected Builder createTypeBuilder(Id id) {
 *       return new Builder(registry, id);
 *     }
 *   };
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The type returned by {@link #createTypeBuilder(Id)} can extend {@link TagsBuilder}
 * to easily support additional tags being added after the base id requirements are
 * satisfied.</p>
