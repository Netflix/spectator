/**
 * <p><b>This class is an internal implementation detail only intended for use within spectator.
 * It is subject to change without notice.</b></p>
 *
 * <p>Simple scheduler for recurring tasks based on a fixed size thread pool. This
 * class is mostly intended for running short lived tasks at a regular interval.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage</b></p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Scheduler scheduler = new Scheduler(registry, "spectator-polling", 2);
 *
 * Scheduler.Options options = new Scheduler.Options()
 *   .withFrequency(Scheduler.Policy.FIXED_RATE_SKIP_IF_LONG, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
 * scheduler.schedule(options, () -> doWork());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Metrics</b></p>
 *
 * The following metrics can be used to monitor the behavior of the scheduler:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.queueSize</code>: gauge reporting the number of
 *       items in the queue. Note, that for repeating tasks the items will almost
 *       always be in queue except during execution.</li>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.poolSize</code>: gauge reporting the number of
 *       threads available in the pool.</li>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.activeThreads</code>: gauge reporting the number of
 *       threads that are currently executing a task.</li>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.taskExecutionTime</code>: timer reporting the
 *       execution time of an individual task.</li>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.taskExecutionDelay</code>: timer reporting the
 *       delay between the desired execution time of a task and when it was actually
 *       executed. A high execution delay means that the scheduler cannot keep up
 *       with the amount of work. This might indicate more threads are needed.</li>
 *   <li><code>spectator.scheduler.skipped</code>: counter reporting the number of
 *       executions that were skipped because the task did not complete before the
 *       next scheduled execution time.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All metrics with have an {@code id} dimension to distinguish a particular scheduler
 * instance.
