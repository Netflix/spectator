## Getting Started

To use it simply add a dependency:

```
com.netflix.spectator:spectator-ext-log4j1:0.101.0
```

Then in your log4j configuration specify the `com.netflix.spectator.log4j.SpectatorAppender`.
In a properties file it would look something like:

```
log4j.rootLogger=ALL, A1
log4j.appender.A1=com.netflix.spectator.log4j.SpectatorAppender
```
