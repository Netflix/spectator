# Gauges

A gauge is a value that is sampled at some point in time. Typical examples
for gauges would be the size of a queue or number of threads in the running
state. Since gauges are not updated inline when a state change occurs, there is
no information about what might have occurred between samples.

Consider monitoring the behavior of a queue of tasks. If the data is being
collected once a minute, then a gauge for the size will show the size when
it was sampled. The size may have been much higher or lower at some point
during interval, but that is not known.

## Polled Gauges

The most common use of gauges is by registering a hook with Spectator so that
it will poll the values in the background. This is done by using the [PolledMeter]
helper class.

[PolledMeter]: http://netflix.github.io/spectator/en/latest/javadoc/spectator-api/com/netflix/spectator/api/patterns/PolledMeter.html

A polled gauge is registered by passing in an id, a reference to the object, and
a function to get or compute a numeric value based on the object. Note that
a gauge should only be registered once, not on each update. Consider this
example of a web server tracking the number of connections:

```java
class HttpServer {
  // Tracks the number of current connections to the server
  private AtomicInteger numConnections;

  public HttpServer(Registry registry) {
    numConnections = PolledMeter.using(registry)
      .withName("server.numConnections")
      .monitorValue(new AtomicInteger(0));
  }

  public void onConnectionCreated() {
    numConnections.incrementAndGet();
    ...
  }

  public void onConnectionClosed() {
    numConnections.decrementAndGet();
    ...
  }

  ...
}
```

The spectator registry will keep a weak reference to the object. If the object is
garbage collected, then it will automatically drop the registration. In the example
above, the registry will have a weak reference to `numConnections` and the server
instance will have a strong reference to `numConnections`. If the server instance
goes away, then the gauge will as well.

When multiple gauges are registered with the same id the reported value will
be the sum of the matches. For example, if multiple instances of the `HttpServer`
class were created on different ports, then the value `server.numConnections`
would be the total number of connections across all server instances. If a different
behavior is desired, then ensure your usage does not perform multiple registrations.

There are several different ways to register a gauge:

### Using Number

A gauge can also be created based on an implementation of Number. Note the number
implementation should be thread safe. For example:

```java
AtomicInteger size = new AtomicInteger();
PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("queue.size")
  .monitorValue(size);
```

The call will return the Number so the registration can be inline on the
assignment:

```java
AtomicInteger size = PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("queue.size")
  .monitorValue(size);
```

Updates to the value are preformed by updating the number instance directly.

### Using Lambda

Specify a lambda that takes the object as parameter.

```java
public class Queue {

  @Inject
  public Queue(Registry registry) {
    PolledMeter.using(registry)
      .withName("queue.size")
      .monitorValue(this, Queue::size);
  }

  ...
}
```

!!! warning
    Be careful to avoid creating a reference to the object in the
    lambda. It will prevent garbage collection and can lead to a memory leak
    in the application. For example, by calling size without using the passed
    in object there will be a reference to `this`:

    ```
    PolledMeter.using(registry).withName("queue.size").monitorValue(this, obj -> size());
    ```

### Collection Sizes

For classes that implement `Collection` or `Map` there are helpers:

```java
Queue queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue();
PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("queue.size")
  .monitorSize(queue);

Map<String, String> cache = new ConcurrentMap<>();
PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("cache.size")
  .monitorSize(cache);
```

### Monotonic Counters

A common technique used by some libraries is to expose a monotonically increasing
counter that represents the number of events since the system was initialized. An
example of that in the JDK is [ThreadPoolExecutor.getCompletedTaskCount()] which
returns the number of completed tasks on the thread pool.

For sources like this the `monitorMonotonicCounter` method can be used:

```java
// For an implementation of Number
LongAdder tasks = new LongAdder();
PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("pool.completedTasks")
  .monitorMonotonicCounter(tasks);

// Or using a lambda
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = ...
PolledMeter.using(registry)
  .withName("pool.completedTasks")
  .monitorMonotonicCounter(executor, ThreadPoolExecutor::getCompletedTaskCount);
```

For thread pools specifically, there are better options for getting standard metrics.
See the docs for the [Thread Pools extension](../ext/thread-pools.md) for more
information.

## Active Gauges

Gauges can also be set directly by the user. In this mode the user is responsible for
regularly updating the value of the gauge by calling set. Looking at the HttpServer
example, with an active gauge it would look like:

```java
class HttpServer {
  // Tracks the number of current connections to the server
  private AtomicInteger numConnections;
  private Gauge gauge;

  public HttpServer(Registry registry) {
    numConnections = new AtomicInteger();
    gauge = registry.gauge("server.numConnections");
    gauge.set(numConnections.get());
  }

  public void onConnectionCreated() {
    numConnections.incrementAndGet();
    gauge.set(numConnections.get());
    ...
  }

  public void onConnectionClosed() {
    numConnections.decrementAndGet();
    gauge.set(numConnections.get());
    ...
  }

  ...
}
```
